/**
 * Class QueryBuilderTrait
 *
 * The keyword(s) you want the products to match. Can be any
 * length. The following search operators are supported:
 *      - AND (both query tokens must be contained in the product, but not necessarily next to one another)
 *      - OR (any of the query tokens must be contained in the product)
 *      - NOT (e.g. with “ipod AND NOT nano”, you will get products, which match the query “ipod”, but at the same time don’t match “nano”)
 *      - "(phrase match: all query tokens inclosed with double quotes must be contained in the found products in that order)
 *      - () Parentheses, to group expressions So you can formulate a query like this: "apple ipod" ((touch OR classic) NOT nano) AND "32  GB"
 *
 * SearchProducts supports the wildcard ‘*’ for suffix matching, that
 * is: a query ‘bott*’ will match for products, which contain the word
 * “bottle” or the word “bottom”.
 * Search operators “AND”, “OR” and “NOT” must be in capital
 * letters.
